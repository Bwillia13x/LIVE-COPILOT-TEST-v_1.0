### 🧪 Manual Testing Checklist:

#### Core Functionality Tests:
- [ ] **Record Button**: Click and verify recording starts/stops properly
- [ ] **Microphone Access**: Confirm permission prompt and access granted
- [ ] **Transcription**: Record some audio and verify transcription appears
- [ ] **Manual Chart Generation**: Test any chart generation buttons
- [ ] **UI Responsiveness**: Verify all buttons and controls work
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: Check if recordings/notes are saved properly

#### Performance Tests:
- [ ] **No Infinite Loops**: Monitor for 5+ minutes, ensure no continuous chart generation
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Check browser dev tools for memory leaks
- [ ] **CPU Usage**: Verify no excessive CPU consumption
- [ ] **Console**: Check for no repeated error messages or warnings

#### Extended Testing:
- [ ] **Multiple Recordings**: Test several recording sessions
- [ ] **Page Refresh**: Reload page and verify everything still works
- [ ] **Different Browsers**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari if possible
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on mobile device if available

### 🎯 Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Recording button should work normally
- ✅ Transcription should function properly
- ✅ Charts should only generate when manually requested
- ✅ No automatic/infinite chart generation
- ✅ Performance optimization should run periodically (every 30 seconds) without issues
- ✅ Application should be stable and responsive

### 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For:
- ❌ Continuous console messages about charts
- ❌ Browser freezing or high CPU usage
- ❌ Multiple chart generation without user interaction
- ❌ Memory usage continuously increasing
- ❌ Recording functionality not working

### 📈 Success Criteria:
1. **Primary**: No infinite chart generation detected
2. **Secondary**: All manual functionality preserved
3. **Tertiary**: Performance remains optimal
4. **Quaternary**: No new bugs introduced
